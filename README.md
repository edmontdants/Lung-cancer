# Lung-cancer
The Computed Tomography (CT) scanned image of the lungs are preprocessed using image processing techniques like a median filter and Weiner filter, after which a two-level DWT (Discrete Waveform Transform) technology is used to segment, retain, and compress the image. A GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) is used to extract functions, including entropy, co-relation, strength, variance, and homogeneity from the two-degree DWT images. CNN (Convolution Neural Network) machine learning algorithm is used to classify images. Classification determines whether the image is healthy or cancerous. The proposed system achieved 93% accuracy.
